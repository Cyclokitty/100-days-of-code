# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Continued learning with Wes Bos's Es6 course module 13 "Javascript Modules and Using NPM".

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Let's face it. This is New Year's Day. The world is quiet and sleepy after a night of revlry. Except for me. I was asleep a solid hour before 2017 happened and I had a really good breakfast. So, today I worked on the first backend project in FCC -- a timestamp app. I figured out how to grab onto the string typed after "/" in the address bar and change it into a date, whether it is unix or calendar. Next, I have to figure out if the string is not a date. That'll be tomorrow's assignment.

Continued reading Kyle Simpson's excellent JS book "YDKJS: Types & Grammar".

**Thoughts:** I was more afraid of node than node is afraid of me. After quite a few video tutorials I finally just  started the first backend project and I feel good about it!

I still hate algos. All the ones I've seen today on Code Wars are centered on Fibonacci sequences or algebraic thingys. None of them make sense. Ok, I could go back to Khan Academy and bone up on my lost algebra. But do I want to? Not really. Perhaps once I understand node I will.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've realized figuring out if a string is a date is trickier than I first thought. I found a stackoverflow that explains how to figure out if a date is valid in Moment.js. I'm going to learn this today!

The timestamp app is a bit bare and boring. It needs jazzing up. Something that pops! Some pizzazz! And at least one cat!

Ok, looks like I'll need to figure out webpack too.

**Link to work:** [Timestamp(so far)](https://sable-idea.gomix.me/)


### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** The struggle is real, yo!

Read more YDKJS Types & Grammar. I believe I'll be rereading this again very soon. Much of it has gone **swoosh** over my head.

Worked on my timestamp app project. In particular, learned how to use Moment.js in the project. Basically, I figured out how to validate a number and a string, then set the results in divs. I still have to figure out the if statements to request.send all the information. Luckily the format is set up already in the app.  

**Link to work:** [Codepen where I fiddled with Moment.js](http://codepen.io/Cyclokitty/pen/jyOYey?editors=1011)

**Thoughts:** I'm bothered that I learn in almost complete silence unless I'm working on a video tutorial. I realized that I don't play music, or a podcast, or have white noise playing in the background. I used to always study with music. I signed up for a free Spotify account and now I have no idea what to play because there is so much to choose. Oh, conundrums!

Ok, settled on "Canada Viral 50".

**Other Stuff** Other stuff I'm doing today: cleaned off the junk table in the dining room and boxed up Daisy's toys. This was sad for me and Shaun because we still miss Daisy terribly. I hope she doesn't think we are boxing her up too. We talk about her every day and love the little bundle of foofyness.

Set my mtn bike on the trainer in the basement. I'm a lazy beast. I need to get back in shape because simple walks are tiring me out and I like cake too much. I have figured out the bike music: not music but the "My Favorite Murders" podcast. It is amazing! Gonna start with 15 minutes of spinning each day this week to get my hammies accustomed to the bike seat this week.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on my timestamp app! Looking good so far.

And then my day exploded. Ok crazy stuff. Ha!

YES!!!! I finished the timestamp app!!!

Life and js are good.

**Thoughts:** wow whoah. Node is a learning curve. Ok, I sorted out a pretty basic, bare bones app. Time to up my mad skillz and improve on the next project.

**Link to work:** [Timestamp is here!](https://sable-idea.gomix.me/)

### Day 5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coming down from a coding success high because I finished that timestamp microservice app. phew! I tire me out.

Special note: Received my pack of stickers from Hacktober! Yay! Laptop decorating this weekend

Worked on Wes Bos' excellent Javascript 30 from day 10 to day 12. What I like about this course is it isn't about algorithms. It's about having a functioning website and you link to the html elements in vanilla js and make them work. Such a relief after all of the mathy algos (which I hate).

Spotify Music: 70s Smash Hits

**Thoughts:** It was hard concentrating today after yesterday's project completion high. I had to keep pulling myself back to my laptop and settle myself back down. I may need in the future to treat the day after I finish a project a day of reading JS rather than sit and do code. Not sure. Will sort it out.

This is my new favourite webpage: [Cornify](http://www.cornify.com/)

### Day 6: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I went to Barrie, Ontario for the day to help my mom with our family cat, Freddie. He has a crumpled ear, IBS and an irritated liver and needed another B12 shot. Oh the fun! He needs to take these shots for another 4 weeks and the vet showed my mom how to give Freddie and needle. Next Friday, I'll head back up and help her.

Thus, my programming work was all theoretical. I read more of Kyle Simpson's YDKJS Types & Grammar. In particular an interesting chapter about explicit and implicit coercion. Especially "So, don't just blindly use === everywhere simply because that's what your code tools tell you to do, or (worst of all) because you've been told in some book to not think about it. You own the quality of your code."

You own the quality of your code.  
=================================
^       
|
|  
That, right there, needs stitching on a pillow.

I also listened to a Code Newbies podcast with Alex Kallaway (righteous dude who figured out #100DaysOfCode). I have quite a few of the CN podcast stored up that I need to listen to over the next couple of weeks.

**Thoughts:** Good grief, I hate bus rides. But they are excellent places for reading javascript theory. Thank the cats that Kyle Simpson wrote such an incredible series that clears much haze off the mysteries I confuse myself with when I code.

### Day 7: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spending today learning how node works and making a nice, little node boiler for my projects. I'm watching "Learn and Understand NodeJs" with Tony Alicea. I did his Javascript Weird parts course and it helped clear up many misunderstandings I had about js. I have hopes that his Nodejs course will explain some nitty gritty bits that I need.

Tony is verbose. Great course but has lots of details from his Js the weird stuff course. I'm plugging away.

As I plugged away, I made a basic, basic, basic [node app](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cknode). It was fun and I'm enjoying the server side of web development.

**Other Stuff:** Last week I ordered what looked like a sweet looking laptop stand for my desk. I was using a stack of web dev books which was ok but inconvenient since now and then I needed to dig out one of the books. Finally caved and checked out laptop stand on amazon. I received it yesterday and OMG it is better than I thought! It's a thick, curved piece of aluminum and it holds my laptop at the perfect angle. Now, I'm thinking I need a nicer monitor stand because it too is sitting on several books. Yeah, my desk is looking swish!

I also combined several small slips of paper with cli commands, github commands, and heroku commands into one small notebook. Much better!

### Day 8: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Continuing my node js adventures. We use Express lots in Node so I'm making a basic node app with it. It's a lot shorter and straight forward.

Nothing to the app. I can grab the words past '/' and then type them on the screen.

[Node Express app](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/node-express)

Watched more of Tony Alicea's Understanding Node. It is slow going. Nice that he works on js functions even if it's a bit repetitive.

### Day 9: January 9, 2017

**Things to Do**
✅ start second FCC backend project: [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice)

✅ figure out how to deploy to Heroku

✅ theory reading: YDKJS Types & Grammar, and Javascript Allongé

**Today's Progress:**
YES! Completed the [request header parser](https://cyclokitty-header-parser.herokuapp.com/) !

**Thoughts:**
There was a lot of googling figuring out how expressjs works -- especially the headers. Luckily there is a lot of practicing coming up!

Also, I learned how to deploy my apps to Heroku. Changed my app name too. This was a good day!

**Link to Work:**
[request header parser](https://cyclokitty-header-parser.herokuapp.com/) and the [repo](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cyclokitty-header-parser)


### Day 10: January 10, 2017

**Things To Do:**

First day of MongoDB University! Databases are vital and I will learn how to use them in my backend projects!

**Today's Progress:**
HOly smokes! It was challenging first day of MongoDB. First, this was my first tarball. Second, playing in the terminal is neat but I always imagine the marvelous ways I can screw up my laptop. It's so new. Luckily I like new and dove right in. I already passed the first 2 quizzes. Keener! lol!

Currently watching the basic nodejs install and server start up. I've done these things. Just watching to make sure I don't miss something. So far, it's all good.

I did have one problem. The db said I did not have enough soft rlimits. I worried that it meant my project would fail in the future. My google-fu saved me again because I found the answer on stackoverflow. Wrote a note in my MongoDB binder (yes, I write in a book. On paper. With a bright blue Sharpie pen.) for the future. Works! Yay!

### Day 11: January 11, 2017

**Things To Do**
- continue the MongoDB Uni course
- work on algos for a resume
  -- HA! completed all 4 algos
- read 1 chaper in JS Allongé

**Thoughts:**
Feeling lazy and having a late start to my day.

I'll feel better after doing some coding.

And I did feel much better after coding those 4 algos. In fact, they were for a web dev job application and I decided to send my resume with the the 4 algos to the company.

  **cross fingers!**

### Day 12: January 12, 2017

**Things To Do:**

- continue MongoDB Uni week 1

- read chapter in JS Allongé (it's very good)

**Thoughts:**

You know what is important when coding? Your desk set up. I've been working on mine for the past month or so. I know have a sweet Coding Studio -- monitor on a stand, laptop on a stand, places for pens and rulers and whiteboard markers and places for my notebooks, mouse & pad, and my lucky dice.

YES! I finished the 3 assignments for MongoDB Uni.

### Day 13: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Nearly all theory reading today because I went to my mom's to give the House Panther a B12 shot.

Read:
  - Javascript Allongé (about functions)
  - YDKJS This & Prototypes (half a chapter)
  - DOM Enlightenment (first chapter)

I set up a Github repo for this week's MongoDB Uni challenge problem: Create Movie Entries. As well, set up a folder for the project in Atom.

**Thoughts:**
Cats are fine with needles if you do the deed quickly.

## Day 14: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Wow! I learned loads today! I completed this week's MongoDB challenge question. I added a routing page for the db retults but it isn't quite working yet. Need more work on it.

**Thoughts:**
On January 28 there is a node class downtown. When I found the free ticket link, the free tickets were already gone. But I added my name to a waiting list and I received a free ticket! yay!

**Late Night Coding:**

Ha! I re-watched the video about finding and rendering db results and I found where I made my error.

Corrected it. The app works! It WORKS! Muhahahahaha!

### Day 15: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

We decided to ditch work and studying and enjoyed a lovely family day together.

I did work on the appearance of my Movie Logger. Added Bootstrap and worked on making the components work with Bootstrap. It's already looking better!

## January 16, 2017

**Day Off!**
I decided I needed a day away from coding. Instead, I enjoyed a lovely family day. Saw Rogue One at the movie theatre. Ate far too much popcorn.

Tomorrow, I code!

## Day 16: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I worked on videos and techniques from MongoDB Uni's week 2. I see lots of methods for programming button clicks. I hope this is possible.

Node.js is getting more and more interesting. I tried out  yargs and nodemon libraries. I'm thinking about making my Movie Logger project into a desktop app using Express.

[Password Manager made with node.js (infant state)](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/password-manager)

## Day 17: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I found out there is an updated Node.js course on Udemy with Andrew Mead. He's a good instructor. Bought it!

But first I finished the password-manager app and it was fun and I learned a lot.

## Day 18: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Completed my week 2 homework for MongoDB Uni! yay!

Set up my third FCC backend project: URL Shortener Microservice on github.

Working on the Node.js course. I made a lot of progress and worked on ternary conditionals. I'm looking forward to figuring out how to set up MongoDB database to my projects. (Especially the fcc backend projects).

## Day 19: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Finished note-makr videos and app. I may actually use it.

Began a new project 'weather-app'. Again, terminal app. I'm looking forward to building bigger apps.

Read more about MongoDB (creating db) and some npm modules to work my next backend project (Short-Url-Service) to confirm an URL is valid and to give a random code to replace the URL.

### Day 20: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

freecodecamp released the beta version of the soon to be released curriculum so I decided to take a gander at it and ended up completed the first chunk of lessons. The lessons aren't linked up and the instructions for setting up gomix.me was missing. I have used gomix.me before (when it was called hyperdev) so it didn't take long to get my complilation project made.

I made this: [abhorrent-forks](http://abhorrent-fork.gomix.me/)

We're using gomix.me instead of heroku for the backend projects. Gomix.me feels kindo of like codepen -- easy to start up but doesn't necessary teach you how to set up projects locally and gitting your repos. I will copy all my gomix.me stuff locally and push to git that way.

The mongoDB and mongoose lessons are very barebones and nearly useless. Hopefully they get fleshed out.

Then, I continued with my Node.js course. We mostly finished the weather app and tomorrow I will begin the Web Servers and Apps Deploy section. I'm anxious to get to the MongoDB and Mongoose sections.

## Day 21: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

yay! Figured out how to grab, validate, and assign a shortid for my Url Shortener project. All I have to do now is wire up the mongodb and an mLab account. I'm aiming for Thursday for all this to happen. (Tomorrow, spending day with my mom!).

Spent some time learning Promises. I need more practice.

**Link To Work:**

[My Short-Url-Service](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/short-url-service)

## Day 22: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Consisted of all theory reading you can do on Go Transit buses from Toronto to Barrie. I read the chapters about Promises in YDKJS Async and Performance and ES6 and Beyond books. I didn't get a chance to today, tomorrow I will rewatch Wes Bos' Promises videos and work on a pile of examples. Promises will be very important in Node!

## Day 23: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

MongoDB Uni course week 3 work is late starting. I'll return to it tomorrow.

Instead, I'm working on Promises (watching Wes Bos' ES6 module #10 on Promises, re-watching Andrew J. Mead's videos on Promises, and reviewing YDKJS Promises in a couple of his books).

And then I'll work some more on Mead's Node.js course. I'm sick of making projects in the terminal. I want to get to the MongoDB and Mongoose sections.

I also figured out how to get ESLint working on my projects, starting with the Short-Url-Service. I have it set to Google ESLint settings but will change over to Airbnb settings.

Ok, so Handlebars.js is pretty cool. I learned a bit today in the Andrew J. Mead course. I love the double curly brackets! Much easier to read and quick to type.

[Weather Online App](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/WeatherApp)

## Day 24: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Webpack 2 has been released and I made acquaintances with the docs. Definitely will need a couple of tutorials figuring out how to use Webpack 2.

Started a list of stickers I want for my laptop. I have a couple on my laptop already and a few I'm sticking on the laptop once I clean it a bit. (Laptop is manky.)

Worked some more on Node.js course and learning more about handlebars.js (on sticker list) and templating. Made some partials for header and footer. Which is great because that's what I want to add to my backend server projects for added sassyness and oomph.

**Link To Work:**

[Weather Online App](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/WeatherApp)

## Day 25: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

More time figuring out handlebars and partials, and learning Express middleware. I had trouble before with middleware and I'm keeping my ears open. So far, so good.

I tried using handlebars (hbs) on my gomix.me backend project (the timestamp) but it's not working well. Tomorrow I will try hbs on my current backend project (url shortener).

Gitter is down this afternoon. I checked twitter and Gitter was doing  maintenance when it went nuts on them.

Ok! Deployed my Weather App. It is ugly and doesn't describe anything weather like. But still, deployed!

[on Heroku!](https://cyclokitty-weather.herokuapp.com/about)

## Day 26: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I finished the section about TDD and I definitely need to try out more testing. This new section of the Mead Node.JS course will cover TDD when we make this Todo app.

I'm disappointed we did not continue the weather app deployed to Heroku. It's just a nothing deployed app. Looks stupid. I think my project this coming week will be making it an actual, weather forecasting app.

Oh! My brain hurts! We are now doing MongoDB, Mongoose, and using Robomongo.

Robomongo is the GUI of the Mongo shell and so much easier. It's all there in front of you. All of the dbs, each of their collections, all of the data inside each collection. I no longer feel like I'm flying with my eyes covered. Seriously, Robomongo makes MongoDB a dream.

##Day 27: January 28, 2017

Went to NodeSchool Toronto today. It was the FCC field trip. lol. I worked on Sass with NodeSchool's terminal program. Next up, figure out how to use Sass in my projects.

I also picked up a couple of new stickers for my laptop: Digital Ocean Canadian shark and a NodeSchool Toronto sticker. Very nice.

Tomorrow will be a full day: I must do my MongoDB Uni work! The homework is due on Tuesday and that day I'll be at my mom's. Needs to be done by Monday. And of course keep working on my Node projects! Getting closer to linking up a db to my Url Shortener!!

##Day 28: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

OMG MOngoDB Uni was terribly dull today.

2 hours of mind numbing pain.

Oy.

I'm heading back to the Mead Node.js course since it is covering basic MongoDB.

Also, found a Webpack2 tut on Youtube. Looks good.
Saving link here [Webpack2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWmkBNBTbMM)
Will do this over the next week or so.

More MongoDB in the Node.js course. Thanks to the previously mentioned dull course, this so far has been rather easy.

## Day 29: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Monday Means More MongoDB :)

We moved on to Mongoose.js and Postman.

Tonight, I read up on Mongoose docs for more work tomorrow.

## Day 30: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Whoah! What a day! It first started terribly. None of my code worked. Nothing I read made sense. And I spent half the day frustrated as heck.

Then I had an iced mocha and a slice of pizza and my code worked!

AND NOW I'M NEARLY DONE MY URL SHORTENER!!!!!!!

All that is left is hooking up to heroku and mLab and a bit of cleaning up. YAY!

**Link to my work:**

##Day 31: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

All theory reading today. Read YDKJS "Async & Performance" and Prof. "Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide To Functional Programming".

Looking forward to deploying my url shortener tomorrow!

##Day 32: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

WOO FINALLY FINISHED AND DEPLOYED!

My url shortener!! With mLab configed to heroku.

Good times!

##Day 33: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Spent some time answering questions on FCC's gitter chat.

Set up my next backend api project: Image Search Abstraction Layer. I was worried I'd have trouble finding a free api for the image search. Google deprecated theirs but it can still be used.

Found an nmp that solves all my problems. Set up the custom search engine and I'm off and running!

It barely works but it's a start.

I'm also thinking ahead to the bigger projects coming up soon. Like the voting app and the nightlife co-ordination app. Just getting some ideas and finding some tuts about using css, Sass, and Webpack2 in those bigger projects.

##Day 34: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

YES! I finished my Image Search Abastraction project!

It works. It reaches and changes the database. All I have left is setting up mLab and Heroku. Then, it's off to the next one!

Also, I went to this week's FCC meetup downtown. It was nice.

##Day 36: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Finished the final backend microservice api projects!

Today, decided to do a project to prepare myself for the next 5 big Dynamic Web App Projects. Gonna combine ye olde weather app with a weather photo gallery. Changes may happen.

Also, watched a couple of Wes Bos videos about his work stack and workflow and tooling. They were good. Signed up for his free command line power user course too. I really want iTerm.

Installed iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh and a new theme for Oh My Zsh. It was a bit of a bear but it looks nice and bright. I upped the font size to prevent headaches.

## Day 37: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I did a whole bunch of things today:

- worked more on the Mead Node.js course. I like Mongoose.

- nearly perfected oh my zsh colours

- and mocked up (in rough) my weather app project

- worked on said weather app. I can get the lat and lon for a city and display it on the home route! Nice!!

## Day 38: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Meh. My todo app course frustrated me today. I had a heck of a time with some lost ; in my code for the server tests. Drove me around the bend for an hour! Finally just redid the entire page. It worked at last.

Then because my brain was feeling a burnt, I decided to style my weather app using Bootstrap 4. Oy vey. It's better, kind of. At least the POST results go on a styled page rather than a couple of bland lines on a res.send.

Tomorrow, I'm concentrating on the weather app. The todo course is taking forever.

##Day 39: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I made a tweet bot and it is neat. I will read more of the docs tomorrow. I retweeted a few random tweets and favorited them too. Very cute.

Then I used up a fair number of brain cells helping with a node question. A noob in fcc was confusing front end and backend and when to use the front end and when to use the backend, in particular with modules. It took a while to sort it out. I think he believed the front end is better done separately from the backend. It hurt my brain.

## Day 40: February 11, 2017

Doing some vocabulary work today.

- closures
- currying
- IIFEs
- factory functions

Haven't figured out if "recursive dynamic memoization" is a thing or what.

@mpjme on youtube has great videos explaining all of the above. He's cool.

## Day 41: February 12, 2017

Worked some more on closures, currying, recursive, and Promises with @mpjme's videos.

My weather app finally shows the weather for whatever city you enter! and it works on heroku!

Now, set it up with a photo gallery and figure out a sign in. Hello, this weeks chores!

[weather app](https://cyclokitty-weather.herokuapp.com/)

## Day 42: February 13, 2017

Well, filled up my 5 free apps on Heroku. I thought of making up a new account but instead I'm trying out gomix.me.

I had to delete about a dozen projects from the first time I tried it out. Something tells me it'll be fine for my 5 dynamic web app projects!

Worked some more on the Mead node.js project but got bored. I'm moving over to figuring out authorization using some tutorials I found. [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local)

## Day 43: February 14, 2017

Finished the first part of the passport authentication. Looks pretty straight forward.

(famous last words)

So, the plan for my weather app is
  - have a weather finding app (done!)
  - have a weather themed photo gallery
  - have auth to comment on photos and to add to the gallery

Whoah! Lots to do still! I better get cracking at it.

## Day 44: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I'm getting comfortable building a webpack config file for my 5 dynamic web apps. Not terribly comfortable but softly comfy. I followed an online tut that makes a webpack.config.file. I did a stripped down version of it until I discovered webpack-dashboard. I love a fancy dashboard! It took some googling but I have it working.

There is an hour long video tut I will do next. I think you make an app. Not sure. It was highly recommended.

Then it's back on that wild React pony! I need it for the dynamic web apps.

Still need to work on my weather gallery app but I feel the projects need more advanced setting up and the weather gallery app I planned won't do it. Upping my fullstack web dev skillz!

## Day 45: February 16, 2017

I worked some more on Webpack and found an excellent and comprehensive video tut on youtube. OMG so much understanding. [Emil Oberg's webpack tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWmkBNBTbMM&t=253s)

Found another quick tutorial on youtube for React. It's a crash course. Goodness knows I need a crash course in React. So far, so good!

##Day 46: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Found a data structures and algos book on Amazon today! I looked for any kind of js algo instruction book after a fruitless two hours on an FCC advanced algo: Inventory Update. My frickin' head hurts! It looked straight forward and I thought I had it nailed but no. Not even lightly pinned to a cork board.

Lovely weather and it was too nice to spend it indoors at the Nodeschool coffee and code. Oops. Next month.


## Day 47: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Spent a couple of hours on CS50 course and the new data structures and algos book. I'm learning C language now! OOO!

## Day 48: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Busy completing the video tutorial for wk 1 of CS50 and the first two assignments. I'm glad I've already set up and played with Cloud 9. I like new setups but I only had a couple of hours today to study and code. CS50's C9 IDE set up was painless and I already know my way around the folder, work screens and terminal. I like cli. Cli is fun.

I began the Mario assignment today and it is trickier than I thought.

## Day 49: February 21, 2017

Finished CS50's week 1 assignments and sent them in and they worked! Hoorah!

Back to React. grumblegrumble I will love React.

## Day 50: February 22, 2017

I enjoyed the CS50 course so much that I decided to watch week 2's video and work on the first assignment.

The video was interesting and I finished the initials.c assignment pretty easily. I'll work on the next two tomorrow.

## Day 51: February 23, 2017

I spent a couple of hours on the caesar cipher. The video about how to work out the cipher was one of the best I've ever seen. I'm at the last part of the cipher and Ihave more thinking to do.

## Day 52: February 24, 2017

Whooo boy. More work on the Caesar's cipher and I'm nearly there! It mostly works but if someone uses a largish number for a key (like 65) then the result alphabet search gets squirrely. I think I need a while loop to work it out. And then there is a line of code I need to return a message. I'll have to look back a bit in the notes and sort it out.

Also, finished a chapter in the data structures and algos book. I'm learning about Stacks. it's quite cool.

## Day 53: February 25, 2017

Finished the Caesars Cipher! It works! It passed the tests! It's over 200 lines of code!

Still have the crack the passwoard question to do. I sped thru it and made a mess of it. I was tired.

##Day 54: February 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Answered a couple of questions on the FCC gitter chat.

Decided to try out Vuejs rather than suffering more with React. So far, so good. Tomorrow I will re-build my nasa pic of the day page with Vue.

##Day 55: February 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Worked on wk1 Effective Thinking Thru Mathematics and I didn't solve the Meanie Genie question. But I did learn something interesting about myself: in the puzzle, you get 9 identical stones and one has the priceless jewel in it. The one with the jewel is slightly heavier and all you get to find it is two balancing scales you can only use each once. My solution was use the scales to crush the stones. Sometimes....

Then, I went back to React to kiss and make up! We're still sorting out our differences and working together for a better future. I hope.

##Day 56: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Ok, so I brushed up on some basic React and decided to swing right into chaos and begin the second React project: the fcc leaderboard.

Set up the body. Made the header and footer. Set up Sass(scss) and I made a rough plan for the table in the center of the project.

Tomorrow, we dance with React!

##Day 58: March 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I took a couple of days off because React was burning a hole in my brain. Learning is stressful and if I'm not making inroads or feeling like I've figured out something (even if it is a mistake -- it is something) then this all gets tiresome.

I visited my mom. Helped with the House Panther's vet appointment. Then, read the latest Sophie Kinsella book. Caught up on naps, laundry and The Killings on netflix.

Today was very good! I added the buttons to the React camper leaderboard project and made them work. Hooray!

There are still a few things to do.

1) It needs to show if we're looking at the top in 30 days or the alltime top campers.

2) It needs to work on gomix.me

Tomorrow. I shall do these things tomorrow!

##Day 59: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Well, I did it! I finished my long dreaded, FCC second React project and it was much more straight forward than I thought. I really chickened out over this project and for rather ridiculous reasons. I'm quite proud of what I made and I'm glad I made it! I pushed it to gh-pages and it now lives online and I linked my source code as well. Good stuff, me!

Now, to work on my application for the summer internship I found. There is a cool mini project to go with it that I'm keen to work on.

#Day 60: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Decided to learn how to make a js library. It's tougher than it looks. I followed a tut and made a cat-namer library. You get a random cat name from a .json. Very cute. Not quite what I had in mind so more searching and coding tomorrow!

**Links to work:**

# Day 61: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Battled an awful headache today and did not do much other than light research into my cost pricing library. That's my new project! This will give me a chance to learn testing as well as building a small library. I'm using Mocha and Chai for the testing. The base files for the cost pricing library are set up. Next step, plan out the library!

[pricer](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/pricer)


# Day 62: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I had a solid day of learning and discoveries!

1) I returned to codewars and completed an algo. Basically figuring out making basic Array.prototype functions. It took some googling but I got it! yay!

2) I need tests for my pricer project so I did some googling and looked up tuts for Mocha and Chai. I found some really long, verbose tuts and some really long, and verbose with poor sound quality youtube tuts. I found a nice, brief video that got me started: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AAIbEAyFxg). Then I went back to the Mocha and Chai docs and sorted out some basic tests. It's just as important to fail the tests as to pass them. In fact, perhaps more important to fail them and figure out what went wrong. In my case, I messed up a function, a require file, and even giving the name of the function I just wrote.

A+ day. Will do again!

#Day 63: March 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I wrote the function for my pricer library and it works really well. The function needs some polishing up and needs some tests. That's tomorrow's fun stuff.

As well, I finished another algo on codewars. oh my. It was over 120 lines long. The answers were more like a few lines to half dozen lines long. In my defense (if there is one), I used a switch statement. Those are always so long.

I added a few names to my cat-namer library. I still need to sort out some npm details before it can go live.

## Day 64: March 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
OO this was a good, good day. I:
* completed a codewar kata
* watched wk 3's CS50 lecture video
* wrote tests for my pricer project (and they work)
* planned out a React project for my portfolio: basically the nasa photo of the day but built with React. Thinking of doing the same with the Scarborough Fare page.

All in all, excellent stuff. Now, some light Saturday night reading about data structures. (lol)

Tomorrow, I'm finishing up (finally) the cat-namer library and publishing it to npm.

Great day! Worked some more on Kyle Simpson's course.

Completed homework for the lambdaschool mini bootcamp. I'm happy to say it was very, very easy. Only googled the areas of triangles, and circles and a prism. Hey, geometry class was ages ago!

#Day 68: March 16, 2017

**today's Progress:**

A low key kind of day. I worked some more on the work 3 CS50 course. Video watching about Big O Notation. I discovered Khan Academy has lots of information about Big O and I've started there as well.

Then I watched the video and did the homework for lambdaschool. Objects this time and it was good practice.

Still need to finish up my React project and work on my resume. That's this weekend's work.

Tomorrow, I'm spending the day with my mom but I have loaded up plenty of theory reading on my iPad for the long bus ride there and back.

**Today's Progress:**

On my bus ride, I read some data structure theory, some DOM Enlightenment, some Clean Coder, and some YDKJS. As well, joined the Giraffe cohort for the Chingu group.

Then, when I arrived at home, I set up the final day of homework for lambdaschool, worked on styling my React NASA photo of the day, and added this bit of logging.

Tomorrow, I'm heading to NodeschoolTO downtown. I also have to go over my resume because on Monday I'm sending in my internship application!

#Day 70: March 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Finished my React Nasa photo of the day. I don't like how the background image only fits when the screen is relatively small. Need to sort that out. Maybe add bootstrap?

Updated my portfolio. Switched out a couple of pages and added the React Nasa one and my npm library cat-namer. Also scrubbed up some details a bit.

***WHOOPS!Forgot to post for a few days!***

**today's Progress:**

I finished day 4 of the lambdaschool course. It was a good reminder and refresher for objects and prototypes. I'm glad I did it.

Found a neat js stack tut to build my big projects: [https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch] Right now, it feels like it's too much stuff. I guess I'll see how it works once I'm done building my new stack. I call it [cyclokitt-boilerplate](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cyclokitty-boilerplate). I remembered to star all of the github library repos so I can review them tonight.

Finally, I completed my internship application yesterday. I'm really hoping I get a call back for the interview this Saturday!! The calls begin tomorrow afternoon and until Friday. Meanwhile, I have this stack tut to complete and my next React project to build. I've also committed myself to building a slack bot in the Chingu-Giraffe cohort. Ok, so some more reading!

#Day 75: March 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I took several days off of coding because I had a internship interview on Friday and I was wiped out! So tired! I needed a few days away from projects and theory and boilerplate building.

The interview was cool. I think I did well and I'm waiting for a call or email. I'm hoping I made it to the next round.

Meanwhile, I took my internship project and turned it into a pirate themed command-line app. It works! Still need to figure out how to test yargs with Mocha and Chai. I keep getting the yargs demands for flagged argvs. I'll come back to it tomorrow.

**Today's Progress:**

Well, sad news. I'm not going to the next level of interveiws. Such is life. There are plenty of dev jobs to apply to and I'll keep on it.

I did get my bad.kitty slack bot running on Heroku. I also tried running it on glitch.me but it was so convoluted and messy I went back to Heroku. Must remember that something like a bot that isn't running with a web page uses a worker in the Procfile rather than web. And to turn off the web and turn on the worker in the Heroku resources page. It works! Now a very unhelpful cat does not inspire users. LOL!

#Day 78: April 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I took a few days off for rest and relaxation. It was a long week and I needed a break.

Today, I decided I need another foray into algorithms and programming with only JS. I completed 16 of the 8kyu algos in codewars. I did surprisingly well with the math questions.

yay me!

Also decided to stop worrying about React and go ahead with the voting app sans React.

#Day 79: April 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

More algos... completed 19 of them. And learned and practiced loads of methods -- especially array methods.

Need to make a list of the algos I've completed and upload them to Github. Tomorrow's task!

#Day 80: April 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

And more algos. Due to internet going down all day long (I sent in a ticket), I only managed a dozen algos.

Think I need a break from the algo grinding. I'll do only a few tomorrow. Otherwise, tomorrow will be a web page building kind of day.

#Day 81: April 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Did more algos and reached 5kyu! Woot!

Then helped a few people on fcc gitter chat.

I ate poptarts.

#82: April 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Spent today building my FCC dynamic app: voting app. Mostly set up the skeleton, played with various templating engines like ejs, hbs, and nunjucks. Nunjucks won! Hurrah, Nunjucks! You got the job.

It does nothing but show a row of nonsense on the index.html. I did a tester for /:words and Nunjacks is definitely working. You type a params and it shows up as the heading in the /:words link. Good stuff!

Tomorrow, I have to learn chart.js and come up with something to vote on. I'm thinking radio buttons. Then, learn passport and auth.

#Day 83: April 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

It was a rainy day. So I coded. My slack chat bot partner pushed some code to our project so I pulled it. Did that locally too with a fetch and a pull. New and improved bad.kitty bot works really well!

I also worked on chart.js. It took some fiddling to change the default fonts, size, and color but I figured out you have to change the defaults.global BEFORE you create a new instance of Chart. And then Ba-Booom! New chart showing off my fav donut flavours! Very easy.

**Today's Progress:**

Started working on a node.js app: Tell Me Your Name. Mostly, I want to work on REST on my own. This is quite a simple app. It's a GET and POST part of RESTful (Representational State Transfer). You add your name to a form (POST) and up your name pops on a new page (GET). It works. Gonna pretty it up tomorrow. I'm thinking rainbows.

I worked some more on my tellmeyourname project. Got the name to show up on a nice page,animated with rainbow colours. A unicorn flies over head. Tomorrow, I'm adding some images to the grassy part of the page. Cats on one side. Plants on the other. It's already hosted on glitch.me

Also decided, since I'm sure some people will type in rude words in the form (lol), I'm going to keep a database for the form entries. For fun. Why not?

#Day 90: April 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

A solid day of coding and learning!

I'm concentrating on building my voting app and I worked on a few key areas:

  * added the signup, login, and about routes for the app
  * added a navbar partial (this was tricky since I haven't used Nunjucks much. But I figured it out. It was easy!)
  * practiced using chart.js in codepen.io and I'm much better at making the poll. I'll have no problem setting up polls but a logged in user should also be able to make polls.

I totally hate the overall appearance of the app. Why am I drawn to colour schemes that remind me of high school sports teams' uniforms?
