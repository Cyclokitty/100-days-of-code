# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.
