# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Continued learning with Wes Bos's Es6 course module 13 "Javascript Modules and Using NPM".

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Let's face it. This is New Year's Day. The world is quiet and sleepy after a night of revlry. Except for me. I was asleep a solid hour before 2017 happened and I had a really good breakfast. So, today I worked on the first backend project in FCC -- a timestamp app. I figured out how to grab onto the string typed after "/" in the address bar and change it into a date, whether it is unix or calendar. Next, I have to figure out if the string is not a date. That'll be tomorrow's assignment.

Continued reading Kyle Simpson's excellent JS book "YDKJS: Types & Grammar".

**Thoughts:** I was more afraid of node than node is afraid of me. After quite a few video tutorials I finally just  started the first backend project and I feel good about it!

I still hate algos. All the ones I've seen today on Code Wars are centered on Fibonacci sequences or algebraic thingys. None of them make sense. Ok, I could go back to Khan Academy and bone up on my lost algebra. But do I want to? Not really. Perhaps once I understand node I will.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've realized figuring out if a string is a date is trickier than I first thought. I found a stackoverflow that explains how to figure out if a date is valid in Moment.js. I'm going to learn this today!

The timestamp app is a bit bare and boring. It needs jazzing up. Something that pops! Some pizzazz! And at least one cat!

Ok, looks like I'll need to figure out webpack too.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** The struggle is real, yo!

Read more YDKJS Types & Grammar. I believe I'll be rereading this again very soon. Much of it has gone **swoosh** over my head.

Worked on my timestamp app project. In particular, learned how to use Moment.js in the project. Basically, I figured out how to validate a number and a string, then set the results in divs. I still have to figure out the if statements to request.send all the information. Luckily the format is set up already in the app.

**Thoughts:** I'm bothered that I learn in almost complete silence unless I'm working on a video tutorial. I realized that I don't play music, or a podcast, or have white noise playing in the background. I used to always study with music. I signed up for a free Spotify account and now I have no idea what to play because there is so much to choose. Oh, conundrums!

Ok, settled on "Canada Viral 50".

**Other Stuff** Other stuff I'm doing today: cleaned off the junk table in the dining room and boxed up Daisy's toys. This was sad for me and Shaun because we still miss Daisy terribly. I hope she doesn't think we are boxing her up too. We talk about her every day and love the little bundle of foofyness.

Set my mtn bike on the trainer in the basement. I'm a lazy beast. I need to get back in shape because simple walks are tiring me out and I like cake too much. I have figured out the bike music: not music but the "My Favorite Murders" podcast. It is amazing! Gonna start with 15 minutes of spinning each day this week to get my hammies accustomed to the bike seat this week.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on my timestamp app! Looking good so far.

And then my day exploded. Ok crazy stuff. Ha!

YES!!!! I finished the timestamp app!!!

Life and js are good.

**Thoughts:** wow whoah. Node is a learning curve. Ok, I sorted out a pretty basic, bare bones app. Time to up my mad skillz and improve on the next project.

### Day 5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coming down from a coding success high because I finished that timestamp microservice app. phew! I tire me out.

Special note: Received my pack of stickers from Hacktober! Yay! Laptop decorating this weekend

Worked on Wes Bos' excellent Javascript 30 from day 10 to day 12. What I like about this course is it isn't about algorithms. It's about having a functioning website and you link to the html elements in vanilla js and make them work. Such a relief after all of the mathy algos (which I hate).

**Thoughts:** It was hard concentrating today after yesterday's project completion high. I had to keep pulling myself back to my laptop and settle myself back down. I may need in the future to treat the day after I finish a project a day of reading JS rather than sit and do code. Not sure. Will sort it out.

### Day 6: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I went to Barrie, Ontario for the day to help my mom with our family cat, Freddie. He has a crumpled ear, IBS and an irritated liver and needed another B12 shot. Oh the fun! He needs to take these shots for another 4 weeks and the vet showed my mom how to give Freddie and needle. Next Friday, I'll head back up and help her.

Thus, my programming work was all theoretical. I read more of Kyle Simpson's YDKJS Types & Grammar. In particular an interesting chapter about explicit and implicit coercion. Especially "So, don't just blindly use === everywhere simply because that's what your code tools tell you to do, or (worst of all) because you've been told in some book to not think about it. You own the quality of your code."

You own the quality of your code.

That, right there, needs stitching on a pillow.

I also listened to a Code Newbies podcast with Alex Kallaway (righteous dude who figured out #100DaysOfCode). I have quite a few of the CN podcast stored up that I need to listen to over the next couple of weeks.

**Thoughts:** Good grief, I hate bus rides. But they are excellent places for reading javascript theory. Thank the cats that Kyle Simpson wrote such an incredible series that clears much haze off the mysteries I confuse myself with when I code.

### Day 7: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spending today learning how node works and making a nice, little node boiler for my projects. I'm watching "Learn and Understand NodeJs" with Tony Alicea. I did his Javascript Weird parts course and it helped clear up many misunderstandings I had about js. I have hopes that his Nodejs course will explain some nitty gritty bits that I need.

Tony is verbose. Great course but has lots of details from his Js the weird stuff course. I'm plugging away.

As I plugged away, I made a basic, basic, basic [node app](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cknode). It was fun and I'm enjoying the server side of web development.

**Other Stuff:** Last week I ordered what looked like a sweet looking laptop stand for my desk. I was using a stack of web dev books which was ok but inconvenient since now and then I needed to dig out one of the books. Finally caved and checked out laptop stand on amazon. I received it yesterday and OMG it is better than I thought! It's a thick, curved piece of aluminum and it holds my laptop at the perfect angle. Now, I'm thinking I need a nicer monitor stand because it too is sitting on several books. Yeah, my desk is looking swish!

I also combined several small slips of paper with cli commands, github commands, and heroku commands into one small notebook. Much better!

### Day 8: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Continuing my node js adventures. We use Express lots in Node so I'm making a basic node app with it. It's a lot shorter and straight forward.

Nothing to the app. I can grab the words past '/' and then type them on the screen.

Watched more of Tony Alicea's Understanding Node. It is slow going. Nice that he works on js functions even if it's a bit repetitive.

### Day 9: January 9, 2017

**Things to Do**
✅ start second FCC backend project: [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice)

✅ figure out how to deploy to Heroku

✅ theory reading: YDKJS Types & Grammar, and Javascript Allongé

**Today's Progress:**
YES! Completed the [request header parser](https://cyclokitty-header-parser.herokuapp.com/) !

**Thoughts:**
There was a lot of googling figuring out how expressjs works -- especially the headers. Luckily there is a lot of practicing coming up!

Also, I learned how to deploy my apps to Heroku. Changed my app name too. This was a good day!

### Day 10: January 10, 2017

**Things To Do:**

First day of MongoDB University! Databases are vital and I will learn how to use them in my backend projects!

**Today's Progress:**
HOly smokes! It was challenging first day of MongoDB. First, this was my first tarball. Second, playing in the terminal is neat but I always imagine the marvelous ways I can screw up my laptop. It's so new. Luckily I like new and dove right in. I already passed the first 2 quizzes. Keener! lol!

Currently watching the basic nodejs install and server start up. I've done these things. Just watching to make sure I don't miss something. So far, it's all good.

I did have one problem. The db said I did not have enough soft rlimits. I worried that it meant my project would fail in the future. My google-fu saved me again because I found the answer on stackoverflow. Wrote a note in my MongoDB binder (yes, I write in a book. On paper. With a bright blue Sharpie pen.) for the future. Works! Yay!

### Day 11: January 11, 2017

**Things To Do**
- continue the MongoDB Uni course
- work on algos for a resume
  -- HA! completed all 4 algos
- read 1 chaper in JS Allongé

**Thoughts:**
Feeling lazy and having a late start to my day.

I'll feel better after doing some coding.

And I did feel much better after coding those 4 algos. In fact, they were for a web dev job application and I decided to send my resume with the the 4 algos to the company.

  **cross fingers!**
