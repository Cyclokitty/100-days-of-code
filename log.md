# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Continued learning with Wes Bos's Es6 course module 13 "Javascript Modules and Using NPM".

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Let's face it. This is New Year's Day. The world is quiet and sleepy after a night of revlry. Except for me. I was asleep a solid hour before 2017 happened and I had a really good breakfast. So, today I worked on the first backend project in FCC -- a timestamp app. I figured out how to grab onto the string typed after "/" in the address bar and change it into a date, whether it is unix or calendar. Next, I have to figure out if the string is not a date. That'll be tomorrow's assignment.

Continued reading Kyle Simpson's excellent JS book "YDKJS: Types & Grammar".

**Thoughts:** I was more afraid of node than node is afraid of me. After quite a few video tutorials I finally just  started the first backend project and I feel good about it!

I still hate algos. All the ones I've seen today on Code Wars are centered on Fibonacci sequences or algebraic thingys. None of them make sense. Ok, I could go back to Khan Academy and bone up on my lost algebra. But do I want to? Not really. Perhaps once I understand node I will.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've realized figuring out if a string is a date is trickier than I first thought. I found a stackoverflow that explains how to figure out if a date is valid in Moment.js. I'm going to learn this today!

The timestamp app is a bit bare and boring. It needs jazzing up. Something that pops! Some pizzazz! And at least one cat!

Ok, looks like I'll need to figure out webpack too.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** The struggle is real, yo!

Read more YDKJS Types & Grammar. I believe I'll be rereading this again very soon. Much of it has gone **swoosh** over my head.

Worked on my timestamp app project. In particular, learned how to use Moment.js in the project. Basically, I figured out how to validate a number and a string, then set the results in divs. I still have to figure out the if statements to request.send all the information. Luckily the format is set up already in the app.

**Thoughts:** I'm bothered that I learn in almost complete silence unless I'm working on a video tutorial. I realized that I don't play music, or a podcast, or have white noise playing in the background. I used to always study with music. I signed up for a free Spotify account and now I have no idea what to play because there is so much to choose. Oh, conundrums!

Ok, settled on "Canada Viral 50".

**Other Stuff** Other stuff I'm doing today: cleaned off the junk table in the dining room and boxed up Daisy's toys. This was sad for me and Shaun because we still miss Daisy terribly. I hope she doesn't think we are boxing her up too. We talk about her every day and love the little bundle of foofyness.

Set my mtn bike on the trainer in the basement. I'm a lazy beast. I need to get back in shape because simple walks are tiring me out and I like cake too much. I have figured out the bike music: not music but the "My Favorite Murders" podcast. It is amazing! Gonna start with 15 minutes of spinning each day this week to get my hammies accustomed to the bike seat this week.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

More work on my timestamp app! Looking good so far.

And then my day exploded. Ok crazy stuff. Ha!

YES!!!! I finished the timestamp app!!!

Life and js are good.

**Thoughts:** wow whoah. Node is a learning curve. Ok, I sorted out a pretty basic, bare bones app. Time to up my mad skillz and improve on the next project.
