# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Continued learning with Wes Bos's Es6 course module 13 "Javascript Modules and Using NPM".

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Let's face it. This is New Year's Day. The world is quiet and sleepy after a night of revlry. Except for me. I was asleep a solid hour before 2017 happened and I had a really good breakfast. So, today I worked on the first backend project in FCC -- a timestamp app. I figured out how to grab onto the string typed after "/" in the address bar and change it into a date, whether it is unix or calendar. Next, I have to figure out if the string is not a date. That'll be tomorrow's assignment.

Continued reading Kyle Simpson's excellent JS book "YDKJS: Types & Grammar".

**Thoughts:** I was more afraid of node than node is afraid of me. After quite a few video tutorials I finally just  started the first backend project and I feel good about it!

I still hate algos. All the ones I've seen today on Code Wars are centered on Fibonacci sequences or algebraic thingys. None of them make sense. Ok, I could go back to Khan Academy and bone up on my lost algebra. But do I want to? Not really. Perhaps once I understand node I will.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've realized figuring out if a string is a date is trickier than I first thought. I found a stackoverflow that explains how to figure out if a date is valid in Moment.js. I'm going to learn this today!

The timestamp app is a bit bare and boring. It needs jazzing up. Something that pops! Some pizzazz! And at least one cat!

Ok, looks like I'll need to figure out webpack too.
