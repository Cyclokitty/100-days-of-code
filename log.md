# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 21, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wes Bos's 30 Days of Javascript (Day 8 -- Fun with HTML5 & Day 9 -- 14 Must Know Dev Tool Tricks).

Continued learning with Wes Bos's Es6 course module 13 "Javascript Modules and Using NPM".

Also, updated my Nasa Picture of the Day webpage with a few minor CSS tweaks.

**Thoughts:** This is the first day of 100 Days of Code and even though I've been coding for over a year, I feel there is still so much to learn.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Let's face it. This is New Year's Day. The world is quiet and sleepy after a night of revlry. Except for me. I was asleep a solid hour before 2017 happened and I had a really good breakfast. So, today I worked on the first backend project in FCC -- a timestamp app. I figured out how to grab onto the string typed after "/" in the address bar and change it into a date, whether it is unix or calendar. Next, I have to figure out if the string is not a date. That'll be tomorrow's assignment.

Continued reading Kyle Simpson's excellent JS book "YDKJS: Types & Grammar".

**Thoughts:** I was more afraid of node than node is afraid of me. After quite a few video tutorials I finally just  started the first backend project and I feel good about it!

I still hate algos. All the ones I've seen today on Code Wars are centered on Fibonacci sequences or algebraic thingys. None of them make sense. Ok, I could go back to Khan Academy and bone up on my lost algebra. But do I want to? Not really. Perhaps once I understand node I will.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've realized figuring out if a string is a date is trickier than I first thought. I found a stackoverflow that explains how to figure out if a date is valid in Moment.js. I'm going to learn this today!

The timestamp app is a bit bare and boring. It needs jazzing up. Something that pops! Some pizzazz! And at least one cat!

Ok, looks like I'll need to figure out webpack too.

**Link to work:** [Timestamp(so far)](https://sable-idea.gomix.me/)


### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** The struggle is real, yo!

Read more YDKJS Types & Grammar. I believe I'll be rereading this again very soon. Much of it has gone **swoosh** over my head.

Worked on my timestamp app project. In particular, learned how to use Moment.js in the project. Basically, I figured out how to validate a number and a string, then set the results in divs. I still have to figure out the if statements to request.send all the information. Luckily the format is set up already in the app.  

**Link to work:** [Codepen where I fiddled with Moment.js](http://codepen.io/Cyclokitty/pen/jyOYey?editors=1011)

**Thoughts:** I'm bothered that I learn in almost complete silence unless I'm working on a video tutorial. I realized that I don't play music, or a podcast, or have white noise playing in the background. I used to always study with music. I signed up for a free Spotify account and now I have no idea what to play because there is so much to choose. Oh, conundrums!

Ok, settled on "Canada Viral 50".

**Other Stuff** Other stuff I'm doing today: cleaned off the junk table in the dining room and boxed up Daisy's toys. This was sad for me and Shaun because we still miss Daisy terribly. I hope she doesn't think we are boxing her up too. We talk about her every day and love the little bundle of foofyness.

Set my mtn bike on the trainer in the basement. I'm a lazy beast. I need to get back in shape because simple walks are tiring me out and I like cake too much. I have figured out the bike music: not music but the "My Favorite Murders" podcast. It is amazing! Gonna start with 15 minutes of spinning each day this week to get my hammies accustomed to the bike seat this week.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on my timestamp app! Looking good so far.

And then my day exploded. Ok crazy stuff. Ha!

YES!!!! I finished the timestamp app!!!

Life and js are good.

**Thoughts:** wow whoah. Node is a learning curve. Ok, I sorted out a pretty basic, bare bones app. Time to up my mad skillz and improve on the next project.

**Link to work:** [Timestamp is here!](https://sable-idea.gomix.me/)

### Day 5: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Coming down from a coding success high because I finished that timestamp microservice app. phew! I tire me out.

Special note: Received my pack of stickers from Hacktober! Yay! Laptop decorating this weekend

Worked on Wes Bos' excellent Javascript 30 from day 10 to day 12. What I like about this course is it isn't about algorithms. It's about having a functioning website and you link to the html elements in vanilla js and make them work. Such a relief after all of the mathy algos (which I hate).

Spotify Music: 70s Smash Hits

**Thoughts:** It was hard concentrating today after yesterday's project completion high. I had to keep pulling myself back to my laptop and settle myself back down. I may need in the future to treat the day after I finish a project a day of reading JS rather than sit and do code. Not sure. Will sort it out.

This is my new favourite webpage: [Cornify](http://www.cornify.com/)

### Day 6: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I went to Barrie, Ontario for the day to help my mom with our family cat, Freddie. He has a crumpled ear, IBS and an irritated liver and needed another B12 shot. Oh the fun! He needs to take these shots for another 4 weeks and the vet showed my mom how to give Freddie and needle. Next Friday, I'll head back up and help her.

Thus, my programming work was all theoretical. I read more of Kyle Simpson's YDKJS Types & Grammar. In particular an interesting chapter about explicit and implicit coercion. Especially "So, don't just blindly use === everywhere simply because that's what your code tools tell you to do, or (worst of all) because you've been told in some book to not think about it. You own the quality of your code."

You own the quality of your code.  
=================================
^

That, right there, needs stitching on a pillow.

I also listened to a Code Newbies podcast with Alex Kallaway (righteous dude who figured out #100DaysOfCode). I have quite a few of the CN podcast stored up that I need to listen to over the next couple of weeks.

**Thoughts:** Good grief, I hate bus rides. But they are excellent places for reading javascript theory. Thank the cats that Kyle Simpson wrote such an incredible series that clears much haze off the mysteries I confuse myself with when I code.

### Day 7: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spending today learning how node works and making a nice, little node boiler for my projects. I'm watching "Learn and Understand NodeJs" with Tony Alicea. I did his Javascript Weird parts course and it helped clear up many misunderstandings I had about js. I have hopes that his Nodejs course will explain some nitty gritty bits that I need.

Tony is verbose. Great course but has lots of details from his Js the weird stuff course. I'm plugging away.

As I plugged away, I made a basic, basic, basic [node app](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cknode). It was fun and I'm enjoying the server side of web development.

**Other Stuff:** Last week I ordered what looked like a sweet looking laptop stand for my desk. I was using a stack of web dev books which was ok but inconvenient since now and then I needed to dig out one of the books. Finally caved and checked out laptop stand on amazon. I received it yesterday and OMG it is better than I thought! It's a thick, curved piece of aluminum and it holds my laptop at the perfect angle. Now, I'm thinking I need a nicer monitor stand because it too is sitting on several books. Yeah, my desk is looking swish!

I also combined several small slips of paper with cli commands, github commands, and heroku commands into one small notebook. Much better!

### Day 8: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Continuing my node js adventures. We use Express lots in Node so I'm making a basic node app with it. It's a lot shorter and straight forward.

Nothing to the app. I can grab the words past '/' and then type them on the screen.

[Node Express app](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/node-express)

Watched more of Tony Alicea's Understanding Node. It is slow going. Nice that he works on js functions even if it's a bit repetitive.

### Day 9: January 9, 2017

**Things to Do**
✅ start second FCC backend project: [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/request-header-parser-microservice)

✅ figure out how to deploy to Heroku

✅ theory reading: YDKJS Types & Grammar, and Javascript Allongé

**Today's Progress:**
YES! Completed the [request header parser](https://cyclokitty-header-parser.herokuapp.com/) !

**Thoughts:**
There was a lot of googling figuring out how expressjs works -- especially the headers. Luckily there is a lot of practicing coming up!

Also, I learned how to deploy my apps to Heroku. Changed my app name too. This was a good day!

**Link to Work:**
[request header parser](https://cyclokitty-header-parser.herokuapp.com/) and the [repo](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/cyclokitty-header-parser)


### Day 10: January 10, 2017

**Things To Do:**

First day of MongoDB University! Databases are vital and I will learn how to use them in my backend projects!

**Today's Progress:**
HOly smokes! It was challenging first day of MongoDB. First, this was my first tarball. Second, playing in the terminal is neat but I always imagine the marvelous ways I can screw up my laptop. It's so new. Luckily I like new and dove right in. I already passed the first 2 quizzes. Keener! lol!

Currently watching the basic nodejs install and server start up. I've done these things. Just watching to make sure I don't miss something. So far, it's all good.

I did have one problem. The db said I did not have enough soft rlimits. I worried that it meant my project would fail in the future. My google-fu saved me again because I found the answer on stackoverflow. Wrote a note in my MongoDB binder (yes, I write in a book. On paper. With a bright blue Sharpie pen.) for the future. Works! Yay!

### Day 11: January 11, 2017

**Things To Do**
- continue the MongoDB Uni course
- work on algos for a resume
  -- HA! completed all 4 algos
- read 1 chaper in JS Allongé

**Thoughts:**
Feeling lazy and having a late start to my day.

I'll feel better after doing some coding.

And I did feel much better after coding those 4 algos. In fact, they were for a web dev job application and I decided to send my resume with the the 4 algos to the company.

  **cross fingers!**

### Day 12: January 12, 2017

**Things To Do:**

- continue MongoDB Uni week 1

- read chapter in JS Allongé (it's very good)

**Thoughts:**

You know what is important when coding? Your desk set up. I've been working on mine for the past month or so. I know have a sweet Coding Studio -- monitor on a stand, laptop on a stand, places for pens and rulers and whiteboard markers and places for my notebooks, mouse & pad, and my lucky dice.

YES! I finished the 3 assignments for MongoDB Uni.

### Day 13: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Nearly all theory reading today because I went to my mom's to give the House Panther a B12 shot.

Read:
  - Javascript Allongé (about functions)
  - YDKJS This & Prototypes (half a chapter)
  - DOM Enlightenment (first chapter)

I set up a Github repo for this week's MongoDB Uni challenge problem: Create Movie Entries. As well, set up a folder for the project in Atom.

**Thoughts:**
Cats are fine with needles if you do the deed quickly.

## Day 14: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Wow! I learned loads today! I completed this week's MongoDB challenge question. I added a routing page for the db retults but it isn't quite working yet. Need more work on it.

**Thoughts:**
On January 28 there is a node class downtown. When I found the free ticket link, the free tickets were already gone. But I added my name to a waiting list and I received a free ticket! yay!

**Late Night Coding:**

Ha! I re-watched the video about finding and rendering db results and I found where I made my error.

Corrected it. The app works! It WORKS! Muhahahahaha!

### Day 15: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

We decided to ditch work and studying and enjoyed a lovely family day together.

I did work on the appearance of my Movie Logger. Added Bootstrap and worked on making the components work with Bootstrap. It's already looking better!

## January 16, 2017

**Day Off!**
I decided I needed a day away from coding. Instead, I enjoyed a lovely family day. Saw Rogue One at the movie theatre. Ate far too much popcorn.

Tomorrow, I code!

## Day 16: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I worked on videos and techniques from MongoDB Uni's week 2. I see lots of methods for programming button clicks. I hope this is possible.

Node.js is getting more and more interesting. I tried out  yargs and nodemon libraries. I'm thinking about making my Movie Logger project into a desktop app using Express.

## Day 17: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I found out there is an updated Node.js course on Udemy with Andrew Mead. He's a good instructor. Bought it!

But first I finished the password-manager app and it was fun and I learned a lot.

## Day 18: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Completed my week 2 homework for MongoDB Uni! yay!

Set up my third FCC backend project: URL Shortener Microservice on github.

Working on the Node.js course. I made a lot of progress and worked on ternary conditionals. I'm looking forward to figuring out how to set up MongoDB database to my projects. (Especially the fcc backend projects).

## Day 19: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Finished note-makr videos and app. I may actually use it.

Began a new project 'weather-app'. Again, terminal app. I'm looking forward to building bigger apps.

Read more about MongoDB (creating db) and some npm modules to work my next backend project (Short-Url-Service) to confirm an URL is valid and to give a random code to replace the URL.

### Day 20: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

freecodecamp released the beta version of the soon to be released curriculum so I decided to take a gander at it and ended up completed the first chunk of lessons. The lessons aren't linked up and the instructions for setting up gomix.me was missing. I have used gomix.me before (when it was called hyperdev) so it didn't take long to get my complilation project made.

I made this: [abhorrent-forks](http://abhorrent-fork.gomix.me/)

We're using gomix.me instead of heroku for the backend projects. Gomix.me feels kindo of like codepen -- easy to start up but doesn't necessary teach you how to set up projects locally and gitting your repos. I will copy all my gomix.me stuff locally and push to git that way.

The mongoDB and mongoose lessons are very barebones and nearly useless. Hopefully they get fleshed out.

Then, I continued with my Node.js course. We mostly finished the weather app and tomorrow I will begin the Web Servers and Apps Deploy section. I'm anxious to get to the MongoDB and Mongoose sections.

## Day 21: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

yay! Figured out how to grab, validate, and assign a shortid for my Url Shortener project. All I have to do now is wire up the mongodb and an mLab account. I'm aiming for Thursday for all this to happen. (Tomorrow, spending day with my mom!).

Spent some time learning Promises. I need more practice.

**Link To Work:**

[My Short-Url-Service](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/short-url-service)

## Day 22: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Consisted of all theory reading you can do on Go Transit buses from Toronto to Barrie. I read the chapters about Promises in YDKJS Async and Performance and ES6 and Beyond books. I didn't get a chance to today, tomorrow I will rewatch Wes Bos' Promises videos and work on a pile of examples. Promises will be very important in Node!

## Day 23: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

MongoDB Uni course week 3 work is late starting. I'll return to it tomorrow.

Instead, I'm working on Promises (watching Wes Bos' ES6 module #10 on Promises, re-watching Andrew J. Mead's videos on Promises, and reviewing YDKJS Promises in a couple of his books).

And then I'll work some more on Mead's Node.js course. I'm sick of making projects in the terminal. I want to get to the MongoDB and Mongoose sections.

I also figured out how to get ESLint working on my projects, starting with the Short-Url-Service. I have it set to Google ESLint settings but will change over to Airbnb settings.

Ok, so Handlebars.js is pretty cool. I learned a bit today in the Andrew J. Mead course. I love the double curly brackets! Much easier to read and quick to type.

[Weather Online App](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/WeatherApp)

## Day 24: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Webpack 2 has been released and I made acquaintances with the docs. Definitely will need a couple of tutorials figuring out how to use Webpack 2.

Started a list of stickers I want for my laptop. I have a couple on my laptop already and a few I'm sticking on the laptop once I clean it a bit. (Laptop is manky.)

Worked some more on Node.js course and learning more about handlebars.js (on sticker list) and templating. Made some partials for header and footer. Which is great because that's what I want to add to my backend server projects for added sassyness and oomph.

**Link To Work:**

[Weather Online App](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/WeatherApp)

## Day 25: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

More time figuring out handlebars and partials, and learning Express middleware. I had trouble before with middleware and I'm keeping my ears open. So far, so good.

I tried using handlebars (hbs) on my gomix.me backend project (the timestamp) but it's not working well. Tomorrow I will try hbs on my current backend project (url shortener).

Gitter is down this afternoon. I checked twitter and Gitter was doing  maintenance when it went nuts on them.

Ok! Deployed my Weather App. It is ugly and doesn't describe anything weather like. But still, deployed!

## Day 26: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

I finished the section about TDD and I definitely need to try out more testing. This new section of the Mead Node.JS course will cover TDD when we make this Todo app.

I'm disappointed we did not continue the weather app deployed to Heroku. It's just a nothing deployed app. Looks stupid. I think my project this coming week will be making it an actual, weather forecasting app.

Oh! My brain hurts! We are now doing MongoDB, Mongoose, and using Robomongo.

Robomongo is the GUI of the Mongo shell and so much easier. It's all there in front of you. All of the dbs, each of their collections, all of the data inside each collection. I no longer feel like I'm flying with my eyes covered. Seriously, Robomongo makes MongoDB a dream.

##Day 27: January 28, 2017

Went to NodeSchool Toronto today. It was the FCC field trip. lol. I worked on Sass with NodeSchool's terminal program. Next up, figure out how to use Sass in my projects.

I also picked up a couple of new stickers for my laptop: Digital Ocean Canadian shark and a NodeSchool Toronto sticker. Very nice.

Tomorrow will be a full day: I must do my MongoDB Uni work! The homework is due on Tuesday and that day I'll be at my mom's. Needs to be done by Monday. And of course keep working on my Node projects! Getting closer to linking up a db to my Url Shortener!!

##Day 28: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

OMG MOngoDB Uni was terribly dull today.

2 hours of mind numbing pain.

Oy.

I'm heading back to the Mead Node.js course since it is covering basic MongoDB.

Also, found a Webpack2 tut on Youtube. Looks good.
Saving link here [Webpack2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWmkBNBTbMM)
Will do this over the next week or so.

More MongoDB in the Node.js course. Thanks to the previously mentioned dull course, this so far has been rather easy.

## Day 29: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Monday Means More MongoDB :)

We moved on to Mongoose.js and Postman.

Tonight, I read up on Mongoose docs for more work tomorrow.

## Day 30: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Whoah! What a day! It first started terribly. None of my code worked. Nothing I read made sense. And I spent half the day frustrated as heck.

Then I had an iced mocha and a slice of pizza and my code worked!

AND NOW I'M NEARLY DONE MY URL SHORTENER!!!!!!!

All that is left is hooking up to heroku and mLab and a bit of cleaning up. YAY!

**Link to my work:**
[my url shortener](https://github.com/Cyclokitty/short-url-service)

##Day 31: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

All theory reading today. Read YDKJS "Async & Performance" and Prof. "Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide To Functional Programming".

Looking forward to deploying my url shortener tomorrow!
